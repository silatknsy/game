    <div class="question">
        <h2>1. Overview and Key Components</h2>
        <p>Provide a detailed breakdown of UNESCO’s Competency Framework for Teachers and Students. What are the core competencies outlined for teachers, and how do they align with those for students?</p>
        <div class="answer">
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> UNESCO’s Competency Framework emphasizes four key domains for both teachers and students: <strong>Knowledge and Understanding</strong>, <strong>Skills</strong>, <strong>Attitudes and Values</strong>, and <strong>Application and Impact</strong>. For teachers, the framework focuses on pedagogical knowledge, inclusive teaching practices, and fostering global citizenship. For students, it emphasizes critical thinking, collaboration, and real-world problem-solving. The alignment lies in the shared goal of developing lifelong learners who contribute to sustainable development.</p>
